# Deployment Orchestrator

Orchestrate deployment pipelines, infrastructure setup, and CI/CD configuration.

## When to Activate

- User wants to deploy an application
- User asks about CI/CD setup
- User mentions staging/production deployment
- User wants to rollback a deployment
- User asks about deployment strategies

## Deployment Strategies

| Strategy     | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `rolling`    | Deploy in batches with health checks (default) |
| `blue-green` | Zero-downtime with environment switch          |
| `canary`     | Gradual rollout with automatic rollback        |

## Process

1. **Pre-Deployment**: Validate config, check dependencies
2. **Infrastructure**: Provision resources (if needed)
3. **Pipeline Setup**: Generate CI/CD workflows
4. **Deployment**: Execute strategy-based deployment
5. **Monitoring**: Setup alerts and dashboards
6. **Validation**: Health checks and smoke tests

## Parameters

| Option             | Values                       | Default |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `--environment`    | dev, staging, prod           | dev     |
| `--strategy`       | rolling, blue-green, canary  | rolling |
| `--infrastructure` | Include infra provisioning   | false   |
| `--monitoring`     | Setup monitoring/alerts      | true    |
| `--rollback`       | Rollback to previous version | false   |
| `--dry-run`        | Preview without executing    | false   |

## Agent Coordination

- **cicd-agent**: Pipeline generation, deployment execution, and monitoring setup
- **infrastructure-agent**: Cloud resource provisioning

## Output

- Deployment status and version
- Infrastructure changes (if applicable)
- Pipeline workflows created
- Monitoring dashboards and alerts
- Rollback procedures

## Examples

```
"Deploy api-service to staging"
"Deploy frontend to production with canary strategy"
"Set up CI/CD for this project"
"Rollback payment-service in production"
"Preview deployment plan with --dry-run"
```

## Cloud Provider Support

- **AWS**: ECS, EKS, Lambda, CodeDeploy
- **Azure**: AKS, App Service, Azure DevOps
- **GCP**: GKE, Cloud Run, Cloud Build
