# Code Analyzer

Provide comprehensive code explanation through multi-agent analysis for architecture, patterns, security, and performance insights.

## When to Activate

- User asks "what does this code do?"
- User wants code explained
- User asks about security or performance
- User wants to understand patterns in code
- Before making changes to unfamiliar code

## Quick Process

1. **Structure Analysis**: Understand architecture and patterns
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Trace imports and dependencies
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify vulnerabilities and issues
4. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate complexity
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify design patterns

## Analysis Depth

| Depth           | Description            | Agents Used                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overview`      | Quick summary          | code-explainer                                          |
| `deep`          | Comprehensive analysis | code-explainer, security-analyzer, performance-analyzer |
| `architectural` | System-level context   | All agents + context-loader                             |

## Focus Areas

- **patterns**: Design patterns, SOLID, anti-patterns
- **security**: Vulnerabilities, input validation, auth
- **performance**: Algorithm complexity, memory, queries
- **all**: Complete analysis (default)

## Output Includes

- **Summary**: Purpose, complexity, maintainability score
- **Architecture**: Patterns, layers, coupling analysis
- **Functionality**: Main purpose, data flow, side effects
- **Dependencies**: Imports, exports, circular dependencies
- **Risks**: Security, performance, maintainability issues
- **Improvements**: Quick wins and refactoring suggestions

## Delegation

For simple explanations, use **code-explainer** directly.

For deep analysis, coordinate:

- **code-explainer**: Architecture and patterns
- **security-analyzer**: Vulnerability assessment
- **performance-analyzer**: Complexity analysis
- **context-loader**: System-level context

## Examples

```
"Explain src/auth/login.ts to me"
"What does this API endpoint do?"
"Analyze the security of the payment module"
"Is there anything wrong with this code?"
```
