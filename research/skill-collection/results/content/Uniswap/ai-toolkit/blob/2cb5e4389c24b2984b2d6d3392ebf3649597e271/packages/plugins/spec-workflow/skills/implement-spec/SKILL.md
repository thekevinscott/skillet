# Implement Spec

Orchestrate implementation of spec-workflow tasks using intelligent agent coordination, parallel execution, and quality gates.

## When to Activate

- User wants to implement spec-workflow tasks
- Spec documents exist in `.spec-workflow/specs/`
- User asks to "execute the spec" or "implement spec tasks"
- Coordinated multi-agent task execution is needed

## Inputs

Parse from request:

- **spec-name**: Name of the spec to implement from `.spec-workflow/specs/`
- **--task**: Specific task ID to implement (optional, defaults to next pending)
- **--parallel**: Enable parallel execution of independent tasks
- **--dry-run**: Preview the orchestration plan without executing
- **--quality-gates**: Enable quality checks between phases (default: true)

## Quick Process

1. **Load Spec Context**: Retrieve requirements, design, and tasks from spec-workflow
2. **Task Analysis**: Decompose tasks and identify dependencies
3. **Agent Selection**: Match tasks to specialized agents based on capabilities
4. **Execution Orchestration**: Coordinate parallel/sequential execution
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validate outputs and ensure consistency

## Orchestration Strategy

### Phase 1: Context & Planning

1. **Spec Loading**:

   - Use `mcp__spec-workflow__get-spec-context` to load spec documents
   - Use `mcp__spec-workflow__manage-tasks` to get task status
   - Identify pending tasks and dependencies

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Map task dependencies from the tasks.md structure
   - Identify parallel execution opportunities
   - Determine critical path for sequential tasks

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration

**If agent-orchestrator is available** (from development-codebase-tools plugin):

Invoke it with comprehensive context including:

- Loaded specs and pending tasks
- Task dependencies
- Execution strategy (parallel vs sequential)

The orchestrator will:

- Discover all available agents
- Use **agent-capability-analyst** for optimal matching
- Coordinate specialized agents for each task
- Handle parallel execution groups

**Fallback (if agent-orchestrator is not available)**:

Execute tasks sequentially without orchestration:

1. Process tasks in dependency order from tasks.md
2. For each task, directly invoke the most appropriate available agent
3. Pass task context and previous results to each agent
4. Continue until all tasks are complete or a blocker is encountered

### Phase 3: Task Execution

For each task, coordinate:

1. **Code Implementation Tasks**: code-generator, test-writer, documentation
2. **Refactoring Tasks**: refactorer, style-enforcer, agent-tester
3. **Infrastructure Tasks**: infrastructure-agent, cicd-agent
4. **Migration Tasks**: migration-assistant, agent-tester

### Phase 4: Quality Gates

Between task groups, apply quality checks:

- **Code Quality**: style-enforcer, security-analyzer, performance-analyzer
- **Test Coverage**: agent-tester, test-writer
- **Documentation**: documentation, review-plan

## Output Format

Return structured results:

- **Summary**: spec name, tasks completed/remaining, execution time
- **Execution Plan**: phases, tasks, agents, execution type
- **Results**: per-task status, agent used, duration, quality metrics
- **Next Steps**: remaining tasks, blockers, recommendations

## Examples

```
"Implement the user-authentication spec"
"Execute spec tasks for payment-integration"
"Run the api-refactor spec with parallel execution"
"Implement spec migration-plan --dry-run"
```

## Delegation

**Primary**: Invokes **agent-orchestrator** (from development-codebase-tools plugin) with spec context, task dependencies, and execution configuration.

**Fallback**: If agent-orchestrator is unavailable, executes tasks sequentially using direct agent invocations based on task type.
