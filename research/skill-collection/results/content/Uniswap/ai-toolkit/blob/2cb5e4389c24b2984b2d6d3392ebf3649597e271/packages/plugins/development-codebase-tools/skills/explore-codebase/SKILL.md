# Codebase Explorer

Build comprehensive understanding of codebase areas before implementation or to answer questions about how things work.

## When to Activate

- User asks "how does X work?"
- User wants to understand existing code
- User asks where something is implemented
- Before planning any feature (preparation step)
- User asks about architecture or patterns
- User wants to trace data flow or execution

## Quick Process

1. **Identify the topic** from user's natural language
2. **Map relevant files** using Glob and Grep
3. **Trace dependencies** and integration points
4. **Identify patterns** and conventions
5. **Document findings** for implementation work

## Input Parsing

Extract from user's request:

- `topic`: Main area/feature/component to explore
- `files`: Specific files mentioned (optional)
- `focus`: Particular aspects to emphasize (optional)

## Delegation

Invoke the **context-loader** agent with extracted parameters for comprehensive analysis.

## Output Format

Return structured analysis:

- **Summary**: Executive overview of the area
- **Key Components**: Core files and responsibilities
- **Patterns**: Conventions to follow
- **Dependencies**: External integrations
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Gotchas**: Non-obvious behaviors and pitfalls
- **Implementation Notes**: Key considerations for new work

## Workflow Integration

This is **Step 1** of the implementation workflow:

1. **Explore** (this) → 2. Plan → 3. Review → 4. Execute

After exploring, context is automatically available for `/plan` or the `plan-implementation` skill.
