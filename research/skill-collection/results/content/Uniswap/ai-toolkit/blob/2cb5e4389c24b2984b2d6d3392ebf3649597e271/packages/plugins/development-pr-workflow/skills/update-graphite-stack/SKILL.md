# Graphite Stack Updater

Automate Graphite PR stack updates by resolving comments and syncing PRs.

> **Note:** This skill requires Graphite CLI (`gt`) as PR stacking is a Graphite-specific concept. For standard Git workflows, use the `pr-issue-resolver` skill to address PR comments on individual PRs.

## When to Activate

- User has a Graphite stack with comments
- Multiple PRs need updating
- Stack sync needed after changes
- Review comments to address
- User mentions "gt stack" or "update stack"

## Prerequisites

- **Graphite CLI** installed: `npm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli@latest`
- **Repository initialized** with Graphite: `gt repo init`
- **Existing Graphite stack** with PRs to update

> **Why Graphite-only?** This skill manages PR stacks, which is a Graphite-specific workflow. For standard Git workflows, use `pr-issue-resolver` to address comments on individual PRs.

## What It Does

1. **Analyze Stack**: Check structure with `gt stack`
2. **Find Comments**: Identify PRs with unresolved feedback
3. **Address Feedback**: Help resolve comments
4. **Update Stack**: Use Graphite commands to sync
5. **Verify**: Ensure all upstack PRs remain in sync

## Execution Flow

For each PR with comments (bottom to top):

1. Review the feedback
2. Make necessary changes
3. Run `gt modify --no-verify` to amend
4. Execute `gt submit --stack --update-only` to sync upstack
5. Continue until all PRs updated

## Key Graphite Commands Used

```bash
gt stack           # View current stack
gt modify          # Amend current commit
gt submit --stack  # Update all PRs in stack
```

## Options

- Process entire stack or specific PR range
- Filter by comment type (style, logic, performance)
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Auto-commit vs manual review mode

## Output

Progress summary with:

- Number of PRs updated
- Comments resolved per PR
- Remaining unresolved items
- Stack synchronization status

## Optional Follow-up

After updates, can invoke **refactorer** to verify changes maintain quality.

## Examples

```
"Update my graphite stack"
"Address the review comments on my stack"
"Sync the stack starting from PR #123"
```
