# Browser Fallback Skill

## Goals

1. When a browser tool fails, suggest using curl instead
2. Provide actionable curl command examples
3. Handle authentication scenarios gracefully

## Prohibitions

- Never retry failed browser operations more than once
- Don't suggest curl for JavaScript-heavy pages without warning
