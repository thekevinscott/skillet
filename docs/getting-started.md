# Getting Started

Install Skillet and start building evaluation-driven skills.

## Installation

Install Skillet using pip:

```bash
pip install pyskillet
```

## Basic Usage

Skillet provides tools for capturing gaps in Claude Code skills and running evaluations to improve them.

### Capture a Gap

When Claude Code fails or produces suboptimal results, capture it:

```bash
skillet capture
```

### Run Evaluations

Test your skills against captured scenarios:

```bash
skillet eval
```

### Iterate

Use the evaluation results to improve your skills, then run evals again to verify improvements.
