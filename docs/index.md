## What is Skillet?

Skillet helps you build better Claude Code skills through systematic evaluation. Instead of guessing whether your skills work, you capture real failures, measure performance, and iterate with data.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install skillet
```

Capture a gap, run an eval, improve your skill.
