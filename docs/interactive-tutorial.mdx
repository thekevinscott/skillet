# Interactive Tutorial

Experience Skillet in action with this hands-on tutorial. The terminal on the right is a real sandboxed environment - click **Show me** to watch commands execute, or type your own.

## How it works

1. **Read the instructions** on the left panel
2. **Click [Show me]** to execute the command with typing animation
3. **Watch the terminal** respond in real-time
4. **Take over anytime** - just start typing in the terminal
