# Interactive Tutorial

Experience Skillet in action with this hands-on tutorial. The terminal on the right is a real sandboxed environment - click **Show me** to watch commands execute, or type your own.

<Note>
  This is a test of Mintlify's built-in Note component to verify JSX rendering works.

  The interactive terminal component will appear here once we figure out Mintlify's custom component system.
</Card>

## How it works

1. **Read the instructions** on the left panel
2. **Click [Show me]** to execute the command with typing animation
3. **Watch the terminal** respond in real-time
4. **Take over anytime** - just start typing in the terminal

The tutorial will automatically advance when it detects the expected output, or you can click **Skip** to move ahead.
