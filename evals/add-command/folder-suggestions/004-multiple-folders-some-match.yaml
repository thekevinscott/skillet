setup: |
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format/001.yaml
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format/002.yaml
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/code-review
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/code-review/001.yaml
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality/001.yaml

prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Fixed typo in docs"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should use conventional commits format like fix(docs): typo"

expected: |
  Should include "commit-format" as an option (existing, 2 evals) since it matches.
  Should NOT include "code-review" or "haiku-quality" since they don't match commit formatting.
  Should fill remaining slots with new suggestions related to conventional commits.

teardown: |
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/code-review
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality
