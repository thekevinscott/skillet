prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Fixed login bug"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should use conventional commits format like fix(auth): description"

expected: |
  Should suggest exactly 3 NEW folder name options (no existing folders to reference).
  Names should be relevant to "conventional commits" like: conventional-commits,
  commit-format, commit-style, etc.
