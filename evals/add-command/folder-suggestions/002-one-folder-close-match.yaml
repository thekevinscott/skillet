name: suggest-folders-one-close-match

setup: |
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits/001.yaml

prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Added new feature"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should use conventional commits format like feat(scope): description"

expected: |
  Should suggest the existing "conventional-commits" folder first (marked as existing with eval count),
  plus 2 new name suggestions. The existing folder should be prominently featured since it's
  a close match to "conventional commits".

teardown: |
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits
