setup: |
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits/001.yaml
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits/002.yaml
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format/001.yaml
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/commit-style
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/commit-style/001.yaml

prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Added tests"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should follow conventional commits spec"

expected: |
  Should present the existing matching folders as options: conventional-commits (2 evals),
  commit-format (1 eval), commit-style (1 eval). All three are relevant to commit formatting.
  May include these as the 3 options, or prioritize by eval count.

teardown: |
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/conventional-commits
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/commit-format
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/commit-style
