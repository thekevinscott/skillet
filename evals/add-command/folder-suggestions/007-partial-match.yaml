# Folder with partial/fuzzy match - should still recognize relevance
timestamp: 2025-01-15T00:00:00Z
name: suggest-folders-partial-match

setup: |
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/git-commits
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/git-commits/001.yaml
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/git-commits/002.yaml
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/git-commits/003.yaml

prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Deleted unused code"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should use conventional commits with type chore"

expected: |
  Should recognize "git-commits" as relevant to "conventional commits" (both about commits)
  and suggest it as an option (existing, 3 evals). Should also offer new suggestions
  that might be more specific like "conventional-commits" or "commit-format".

teardown: |
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/git-commits
