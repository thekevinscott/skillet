name: suggest-folders-one-not-close

setup: |
  mkdir -p ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality
  touch ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality/001.yaml

prompt:
  - "Write a commit message for: Refactored auth module"
  - "/skillet:add"
  - "Should use conventional commits format like refactor(auth): description"

expected: |
  Should suggest 3 NEW folder names related to "conventional commits" or "commit format".
  Should NOT suggest "haiku-quality" since it's completely unrelated to commit messages.
  The existing folder should be ignored, not presented as an option.

teardown: |
  rm -rf ~/.skillet/evals/haiku-quality
